The app provides two ways to get predictions:

Manual Input:

Select a date
Enter previous sales values (lag_1 and lag_3)
Click "Predict" to get a single prediction


CSV Upload:

Upload a CSV file with 'date' and 'quantity' columns
View predictions for the entire dataset
Download results as a new CSV file



The CSV file should have the same format as your training data, with at least:

A 'date' column (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
A 'quantity' column with sales values
